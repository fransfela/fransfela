  title={Evaluation of Own Voice Perception while Using In-ear Headsets},
  author={Takeuchi, M. and Marozeau, J. and Fela, R. F. and Gkanos, K. and Nørholm, S. M.},
  abstract={Singing or speaking while using a headset or hearing aid can present significant challenges due to the occlusion effect, alongside variances in processing latency and auditory distortions inherent to these devices. Such challenges are particularly pronounced in activities like singing, where precise control over one's vocal quality is paramount for performance. This study investigates the factors detrimental to the perceptual quality of one's own voice when using in-ear headsets and how each factor influences one's perception of self-voice. Prior literature reviews lead to occlusion, sidetone filters, latency, and distortion as the main factors. Twenty-three assessors participated in a subjective evaluation, which was followed by statistical data analysis. Further investigation was carried out through an assessor screening procedure and text analysis was performed on responses to collected open-ended questions. The study found that occlusion and distortion are the influential factors for the changes in self-voice perception, whereas latency is a determinant. Sidetone filtering becomes a significant factor when occlusion effects are minimized.},

  title={Comparison of Full Factorial and Optimal Experimental Design for Perceptual Evaluation of Audiovisual Quality},
  author={Fela, R. F. and Zacharov, N. and Forchhammer, S.},
  abstract={Perceptual evaluation of immersive audiovisual quality is often very labor-intensive and costly because numerous factors and factor levels are included in the experimental design. Therefore, the present study aims to reduce the required experimental effort by investigating the effectiveness of optimal experimental design (OED) compared to classical full factorial design (FFD) in the study using compressed omnidirectional video and ambisonic audio as examples. An FFD experiment was conducted and the results were used to simulate 12 OEDs consisting of D-optimal and I-optimal designs varying with replication and additional data points. The fraction of design space plot and the effect test based on the ordinary least-squares model were evaluated, and four OEDs were selected for a series of laboratory experiments. After demonstrating an insignificant difference between the simulation and experimental data, this study also showed that the differences in model performance between the experimental OEDs and FFD were insignificant, except for some interacting factors in the effect test. Finally, the performance of the I-optimal design with replicated points was shown to outperform that of the other designs. The results presented in this study open new possibilities for assessing perceptual quality in a much more efficient way.},

  abstract={To open up new possibilities to assess the multimodal perceptual quality of omnidirectional media formats, we proposed a novel open source 360 audiovisual (AV) quality dataset. The dataset consists of high-quality 360 video clips in equirectangular (ERP) format and higher-order ambisonic (4th order) along with the subjective scores. Three subjective quality experiments were conducted for audio, video, and AV with the procedures detailed in this paper. Using the data from subjective tests, we demonstrated that this dataset can be used to quantify perceived audio, video, and audiovisual quality. The diversity and discriminability of subjective scores were also analyzed. Finally, we investigated how our dataset correlates with various objective quality metrics of audio and video. Evidence from the results of this study implies that the proposed dataset can benefit future studies on multimodal quality evaluation of 360 content.},

  author={Fela, R. F. and Zacharov, N. and Forchhammer, S.},
  abstract={For accurate and detailed perceptual evaluation of compressed omnidirectional multimedia content, it is imperative for assessor panels to be qualified to obtain consistent and high-quality data. This work extends existing procedures for assessor selection in terms of scope (360? videos with high-order ambisonic), time efficiency, and analytical approach, as described in detail. The main selection procedures consisted of a basic audiovisual screening and three successive discrimination experiments for audio (listening), video (viewing), and audiovisual using a triangle test. Additionally, four factors influencing quality of experience, including the simulator sickness questionnaire, were evaluated and are discussed. After the selection process, a confirmatory study was conducted using three experiments (audio, video, and audiovisual) and based on a rating scale methodology to compare performance between rejected and selected assessors. The studies showed that (i) perceptual discriminations are influenced by the samples, the encoding parameters, and some quality of experience factors; (ii) the probability of symptom occurrence is considerably low, indicating that the proposed procedure is feasible; and (iii) the selected assessors performed better in discrimination than the rejected assessors, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed procedure.},

  title={Perceptual Evaluation of 360 Audiovisual Quality and Machine Learning Predictions},
  author={Fela, R. F. and Zacharov, N. and Forchhammer, S.},
  abstract={In an earlier study, we gathered perceptual evaluations of the audio, video, and audiovisual quality for 360 audiovisual content. This paper investigates perceived audiovisual quality prediction based on objective quality metrics and subjective scores of 360 video and spatial audio content. Thirteen objective video quality metrics and three objective audio quality metrics were evaluated for five stimuli for each coding parameter. Four regression-based machine learning models were trained and tested here, i.e., multiple linear regression, decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine. Each model was constructed using a combination of audio and video quality metrics and two cross-validation methods (k-Fold and Leave-One-Out) were investigated and produced 312 predictive models. The results indicate that the model based on the evaluation of VMAF and AMBIQUAL is better than other combinations of audio-video quality metric. In this study, support vector machine provides higher performance using k-Fold (PCC = 0.909, SROCC = 0.914, and RMSE = 0.416). These results can provide insights for the design of multimedia quality metrics and the development of predictive models for audiovisual omnidirectional media.},

  title={Towards a Perceived Audiovisual Quality Model for Immersive Content},
  author={Fela, R. F. and Zacharov, N. and Forchhammer, S.},
  abstract={This paper studies the quality of multimedia content focusing on 360 video and ambisonic spatial audio reproduced using a head-mounted display and a multichannel loudspeaker setup. Encoding parameters following basic video quality test conditions for 360 videos were selected and a low-bitrate codec was used for the audio encoder. Three subjective experiments were performed for the audio, video, and audiovisual respectively. Peak signal-to-noise ratio and its variants for 360 videos were computed to obtain objective quality metrics and subsequently correlated with the subjective video scores. This study shows that a Cross-Format SPSNR-NN has a slightly higher linear and monotonic correlation over all video sequences. Based on the audiovisual model, a power model shows a highest correlation between test data and predicted scores. We concluded that to enable the development of superior predictive model, a high quality, critical, synchronized audiovisual database is required. Furthermore, comprehensive assessor training may be beneficial prior to the testing to improve the assessors' discrimination ability particularly with respect to multichannel audio reproduction.},

  title={The Effects of Orientation, Window Size, and Lighting Control to Climate-Based Daylight Performance and Lighting Energy Demand on Buildings in Tropical Area},
  author={Fela, R. F. and Utami, S. S. and Mangkuto, R. A. and Suroso, D. J.},
  abstract={The use of daylight offers a positive contribution to building energy savings yet also provoke a shortfall anticipation such as the large amount of light and visual discomfort. Moreover, building energy demand will also depend on the lighting control system combined with occupants’ behaviour of which is still rarely studied. This paper addressed the evaluation of climate-based daylight performance in a simulated reference office with a single unglazed opening measuring various window-to-wall ratio on one of the short façades facing different orientations. Modelling and simulation were performed in Radiance and Daysim using weather data of Yogyakarta and Bandung, Indonesia. Six different lighting control conditions were included. The following metrics observed are: average daylight factor, spatial daylight autonomy, spatial useful daylight illuminance, simplified daylight glare probability and lighting energy demand due to the lighting control system. Sensitivity analysis using multiple linear regression was also included. Excluding the average daylight factor, the results yielded similar trends for each metrics in two cities. However, the trend of sDA and sUDI-e in Yogyakarta are getting higher than Bandung in contrast with lighting energy demand. Moreover, combination switch-off occupancy & dimming system shows the most efficient lighting control system in all conditions.},

  author={Mangkuto, R. A. and Fela, R. F. and Utami, S. S.},
  abstract={Current daylighting simulation practice often ignores the importance of façade thickness, despite its real influence on the total building performance. This research therefore aims to determine the effect of various facade thickness on daylight performance in a simulated reference office. An isolated reference office with an unglazed opening on one of the short façade was taken as case study, modelled and simulated in Radiance and Daysim, using weather data of Bandung, Indonesia. The thickness of the window façade was varied within 0.05~0.50 m, and the following daylight metrics were determined: average daylight factor, spatial daylight autonomy, spatial useful daylight illuminance, simplified daylight glare probability on selected viewpoints, and annual lighting energy demand. Results suggest that variation of façade thickness yields different impacts, which is largely significant on the average daylight factor, but is subtler on the climate-based daylight metrics and lighting energy demand.},

  abstract={Minimizing the operational cost of a building while maintaining the thermal comfort is one of the criteria required in a sport facility building. However, the standard to obtain this condition in Indonesia is not yet available. The thermal comfort condition of a multipurpose sport facility in a public university in Yogyakarta, Indonesia was investigated by observing the air movement through natural ventilation openings. Performance metrics for the thermal comfort are the temperature distribution, relative humidity, air flow rate, and outdoor climate. Simulation was done using SolidWorks 2013 and the thermal condition was known. The results were compared to the Indonesia National Standard (SNI) and Design Guidance Note from Sport England. The average temperature near the arena is 30.09oC with relative humidity of 67%, which meets the category of a comfort warm condition. The spectator seats at the tribune are considered comfortably warm. The sport hall being observed has an air change rate (ACH) of 6.14 which exceeds the standard minimum of 1.5 and therefore, it is in no need of a mechanical ventilation system to support the air circulation.},
