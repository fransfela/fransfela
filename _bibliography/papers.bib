  title={Evaluation of Own Voice Perception while Using In-ear Headsets},
  author={Takeuchi, M. and Marozeau, J. and Fela, R. F. and Gkanos, K. and Nørholm, S. M.},
  abstract={Singing or speaking while using a headset or hearing aid can present significant challenges due to the occlusion effect, alongside variances in processing latency and auditory distortions inherent to these devices. Such challenges are particularly pronounced in activities like singing, where precise control over one’s vocal quality is paramount for performance. This study investigates the factors detrimental to the perceptual quality of one’s own voice when using in-ear headsets and how each factor influences one’s perception of self-voice. Prior literature reviews lead to occlusion, sidetone filters, latency, and distortion as the main factors. Twenty-three assessors participated in a subjective evaluation, which was followed by statistical data analysis. Further investigation was carried out through an assessor screening procedure and text analysis was performed on responses to collected open-ended questions. The study found that occlusion and distortion are the influential factors for the changes in self-voice perception, whereas latency is a determinant. Sidetone filtering becomes a significant factor when occlusion effects are minimized.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
