## Research Overview

My research focuses on understanding and quantifying how humans perceive audio-video quality, with applications in consumer electronics, telecommunications, and multimedia systems. I work at the intersection of **psychoacoustics**, **signal processing**, **machine learning**, and **statistics**.

---

## Current Research Areas

### Audio Quality Assessment

Developing objective quality metrics that accurately predict subjective human ratings for various audio applications including:
- Speech intelligibility in noisy environments
- Music reproduction quality
- Audio codec evaluation
- Acoustic echo cancellation performance

**Key contributions:**
- Novel perceptual models for [specific application]
- Validation studies with [N] participants across [N] countries
- Industry standards contributions (ITU-T, AES, etc.)

---

### Perceptual Modeling & Psychoacoustics

Understanding the fundamental mechanisms of human audio-visual perception:
- Auditory masking and frequency selectivity
- Temporal and spatial perception
- Cross-modal interactions (audio-visual integration)
- Individual differences in perception

**Methods:**
- Controlled listening experiments (MUSHRA, MOS, ABX)
- Psychophysical measurements
- Statistical modeling of perceptual data

---

### Machine Learning for Quality Prediction

Leveraging modern ML/AI techniques to:
- Predict subjective quality ratings from objective measurements
- Develop non-intrusive (no-reference) quality metrics
- Personalize quality models for individual users
- Handle edge cases and challenging acoustic scenarios

**Technologies:**
- Deep neural networks for audio analysis
- Feature engineering from psychoacoustic models
- Transfer learning from large audio datasets

---

### Natural Language Processing Applications

Exploring innovative applications of NLP in perceptual evaluation:
- Analyzing open-ended feedback from listening tests
- Semantic analysis of quality descriptors
- Automated report generation from assessment data
- Sentiment analysis in user experience studies

---

### Item Response Theory in Perception

Applying psychometric models to perceptual evaluation:
- Modeling listener reliability and expertise
- Estimating stimulus difficulty and discrimination
- Developing adaptive testing procedures
- Quality control in subjective assessments
