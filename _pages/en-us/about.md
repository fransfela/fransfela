I'm a Perceptual Evaluation Engineer at [Jabra](https://www.jabra.com/), where I work on audio-video quality assessment for enterprise communication devices. I hold a PhD in [Perceptual Evaluation of Immersive Audio-visual Technology](https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/perceptual-evaluation-of-immersive-audiovisual-quality) from [Technical University of Denmark](https://electro.dtu.dk/), focusing on perceptual modeling and subjective evaluation methodologies.

My research interests span **audio-video quality assessment**, **psychoacoustics**, **machine learning for quality prediction**, and increasingly, **Natural Language Processing** and **Item Response Theory** applications in perceptual evaluation.

Beyond my technical work, I'm passionate about mentoring aspiring researchers. Through [MentoringBangRandy](/mentoring/), I provide 1-on-1 guidance for Indonesian students pursuing Master's, PhD, and Postdoc opportunities internationally.

**Current focus:**
- Developing next-generation audio-video quality metrics
- Bridging perceptual science with machine learning
- Helping researchers navigate their academic journey
